# Discord Screenshot Bot
A discord bot useful for taking screenshots of pages sent in by users. There's probably a better way to do this, but for my purposes this was the best option that I could come up with.

# Table of Contents

# Dependencies
The bot has a few dependencies:
* `firefox`
* `i3 window manager`
* `xdotool`
* `python3`
* `os`
* `subprocess`
* `discord.py`
* `time`
* `dotenv`
